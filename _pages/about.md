Hey, I'm Caio Teixeira. I've been working with software development since 2014, mostly with game development. I am based in São Paulo, Brazil, but I also lived for some time in Los Angeles, California, and Portland, Maine.

## Work
I discovered my passion for technology and computer science through **Game Development**, I used to build small games with RPG Maker during my childhood. I began to build stuff with **Unity3D** 9 years ago when I was doing a final project at High School. After that, I worked on several different game projects, I worked on small game jam projects, built **educational games** for a MOOC, did an internship working on **engine programming for a AAA project**, shipped **three mobile games** for Android and iOS, and worked on several **shared core libraries** used by many different projects.

My strongest technical skills are **Unity3D and C#** (+9 years), **C++**, **Graphics Programming**, and writing **high-performance code** (cache-efficient, parallel programming, SIMD, CPU, and memory utilization, etc.). I strive to be a flexible T-shaped engineer that can work on any kind of technical problem, I am always trying to learn new things out of my comfort zone,  so I also learned the basics of **Web Development**, **Mobile Programming** and **Automation** by working on projects like a WordPress website, **native mobile plugins** for Android and iOS, a **NodeJS** backend for a multiplayer game, a **Docker** based build automation pipeline, etc.

## Education

I went to **University of São Paulo** (USP) where I got a **B.S. in Computer Information Systems**. At USP I learned all the theory and practice about Computer Science and Algorithms, and also went to business classes like business administration, economics, accounting, etc. 

In 2015, I went to a one-year exchange program at **University of Southern California** (USC) where I got a **Video Game Programming specialization** certificate. At USC, I solidified my knowledge of game development by attending several classes on computer graphics, engine programming, advanced C++, multiplayer game development, etc. Most of those classes were taught by games industry veterans, which was amazing and quite inspiring for me.

Right now, I am a graduate student going through the **Online Master of Science in Computer Science** program of **Georgia Institute of Technology**. I am mostly doing it for personal fulfillment, so my goal is to deepen my knowledge on topics like computer architecture, distributed systems, programming languages, high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, etc.

## Hobbies and Interests

These are some of the things that I do when I am not working or studying:

- 🚀 Aviation and Space enthusiast. Before computer science became my clear career goal, I wanted to be a pilot 🙃
- 📈 Financial market, macroeconomics and investing. I was always interested in all of it 🤑
- 📚 Read good books 😀
- ⚔️ I am Fantasy and Sci-fi nerd, always reading and watching all the new good content 🤓
- 🎮 Of course, I like to play good games 😅
